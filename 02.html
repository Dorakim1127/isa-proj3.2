        <p>
        This is, I believe, an electric clock by the watch/clock manufacturer, Seiko. It's a part of their "Melodies in Motion" series, and I'm pretty sure it's similar to the clock that one of my favorite sushi restaurants back home has. I wasn't able to find the restaurant's clock since there aren't many photos but I feel like this Seiko clock has a similar function. At a certain time, it plays a melody and the little figurines inside the clock move around. The one at the restaurant has the figurines extend from the clock, though, which I don't think this one does.
