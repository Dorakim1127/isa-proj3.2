        <p>
        This is an electric clock by the watch/clock manufacturing company, Seiko. It's a part of their "Melodies in Motion" series, except it can play from a range of 7 different Beatles songs. This is the clock my grandparents have in their home; my grandfather is a huge Beatles fan—he loves playing music and is the guitar player in a band. I remember hearing it from across their house every few hours when I was younger and would stay over. This picture is the actual clock in their house!
