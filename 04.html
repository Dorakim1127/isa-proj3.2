        <p>
        This is a mechanic clock by the watch/clock manufacturer Seiko. Unlike electric clocks, mechanical clocks are powered by a wound spring, which stores the clock's energy. When the mainspring slowly unwinds, it begins a series of motions that eventually causes the clock's gears to turn. Like most of Seiko's other clocks, this one plays one of several melodies every few hours.
