        <p>
        This is an example of an electric clock. Electric clocks are powered by electricity, which gives direct impulses to the pendulum, which causes the clocks' gears to turn. In addition to running the clock's gears, the clock's pendulum is also responsible for keeping track of time. The function is somewhat similar to a pendulum clock.
